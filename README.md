# Module 3. JS Core. Lesson 9. Test 3.

# Create MyMath object without Math Methods.

The MyMath object contains a property and math functions:

- MyMath.PI — is a property that returns the number Pi (π).
- MyMath.pow(number, degree) — is a method that returns a number in a certain degree.
- MyMath.abs(number) — is a method that returns the modulus of a number (absolute value).
- MyMath.max(number1, number2...) — is a method that returns the largest (maximum) number from the passed arguments. The number of numbers is unlimited.
- MyMath.min(number1, number2...) — is a method that returns the smallest (minimum) number from the passed arguments. The number of numbers is unlimited.

Each of the methods has a check to see if the passed values are valid and if they are numbers. If not, the methods return an error message.
